## üéØ Project Overview

This project uses the Titanic dataset from Seaborn to build and evaluate **three machine learning classification models**:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Neural Network (MLPClassifier)**

Each model predicts whether a passenger **survived (1)** or **did not survive (0)** using three input cases:

| Case | Features Used |
|------|----------------|
| 1    | `alone` |
| 2    | `age` |
| 3    | `age + family_size` |

The notebook includes:
‚úî Feature engineering  
‚úî Stratified train/test split  
‚úî Decision Trees, SVMs, Neural Networks  
‚úî Confusion matrices and decision boundaries  
‚úî Performance summary table  
‚úî Reflections after each section

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow 1. Set Up Machine

Make sure you have:

- VS Code (with Python, Jupyter, Pylance, Ruff extensions)
- Git  
- uv (Python environment and dependency manager)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow 2. Set Up Project

1. **Clone repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BethSpornitz/ml-bethspornitz
```

2. **Create and activate environment**
```bash
uv venv
uv python pin 3.12
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade
uv run pre-commit install
uv run python --version
```

3. **Activate (Windows)**
```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow 3. Daily Workflow

### 3.1 Pull latest updates
```bash
git pull
```

### 3.2 Keep things clean
```bash
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade
uvx ruff check --fix
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
git add .
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow 4. Save and Push Work

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update Project 3 models and results"
git push -u origin main
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow 5. Documentation

Pushing to GitHub automatically builds your **MkDocs website** from `docs/` using `mkdocs.yml`.

## üß© How the Project Works

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Load Titanic dataset using seaborn |
| 2 | Clean missing values (age = median, embark_town = mode) |
| 3 | Add new feature: `family_size = sibsp + parch + 1` |
| 4 | Encode categories (`sex`, `embarked`, `alone`) to numbers |
| 5 | Define feature cases (alone, age, age + family_size) |
| 6 | Use `StratifiedShuffleSplit` for 80/20 train/test |
| 7 | Train Decision Tree models |
| 8 | Plot confusion matrices + decision trees |
| 9 | Train SVM models and visualize support vectors |
| 10 | Train Neural Network for Case 3 |
| 11 | Create summary table + reflections |

## üìä Model Performance Summary (Test Results)

| Model Type | Case | Features Used | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Notes |
|------------|------|----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Decision Tree** | 1 | alone | 63% | 64% | 63% | 63% | Good balance |
| | 2 | age | 61% | 58% | 61% | 55% | Age alone weak |
| | 3 | age + family_size | 59% | 57% | 59% | 57% | Overfit (train=77%) |
| **SVM (RBF)** | 1 | alone | 63% | 64% | 63% | 63% | Similar to DT |
| | 2 | age | 63% | 66% | 63% | 52% | High precision, low recall |
| | 3 | age + family_size | 63% | 66% | 63% | 52% | Similar behavior |
| **Neural Network (MLP)** | 3 | age + family_size | **66%** | **65%** | **66%** | **65%** | Best overall |

## üí° Key Insights

‚úÖ Neural Network performed best: **66% accuracy**  
‚úÖ Decision Trees easy to read but overfit on Case 3  
‚úÖ `alone` works better than `age` alone  
‚úÖ More features ‚â† better accuracy ‚Äî Case 3 overfit on training  
‚úÖ SVMs are stable but miss many survivors (lower recall)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- Decision Trees got complicated quickly  
- SVM support vectors were confusing at first  
- Neural Network needed higher `max_iter` to train  
- Class imbalance made survival hard to predict  
- Formatting Markdown tables and reflections took time  

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Add features like `sex`, `fare`, `pclass`  
- Try Random Forests or Gradient Boosting  
- Tune hyperparameters (`max_depth`, `C`, `gamma`, layers)  
- Add cross-validation for more reliable performance  
- Push summary table to README and MkDocs site
