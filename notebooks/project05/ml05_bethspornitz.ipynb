    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we learn how to implement and evaluate more complex models when simpler techniques aren't enough. We'll explore ensemble models, a powerful approach in machine learning that combines multiple models to improve performance. Ensemble methods often outperform individual models by reducing overfitting and improving generalization.\n",

    "## Introduction to Ensemble Models\n",
    "- Ensemble models combine the outputs of multiple models to improve predictive performance. Common types of      ensemble models include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boosted Decision Trees – Models train sequentially, with each new tree correcting the errors of the previous one.\n",
    "- Random Forest – Multiple decision trees train in parallel, each on a random subset of the data, and their predictions are averaged.\n",
    "- Voting Classifier (Heterogeneous Models) – Combines different types of models (e.g., Decision Tree, SVM, and Neural Network) by taking the majority vote or average prediction.\n",
    "- Cross Validation – Divides data into multiple folds to improve the reliability of performance estimates.\n"

    "## Performance Models\n",
    "We will evaluate model performance using the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy –  The proportion of all predictions that are correct.\n",
    "- Precision – Proportion of positive predictions that are truly positive.\n",
    "- Recall – Proportion of actual positives that are correctly predicted.\n",
    "- F1 Score – Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics are especially helpful when working with multiple classes (e.g., low, medium, high), not just binary yes/no predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good models have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High Test Accuracy – the model predicts well on new, unseen (e.g., test) data.\n",
    "- High Test F1 Score – especially useful  if some classes (categories) have fewer examples than others.\n",
    "- Small Gap between Train and Test accuracy – shows the model is generalizing well (not overfitting or underfitting).\n",
    "- Small Gap between Train and Test F1 score – shows the model is generalizing well (not overfitting or underfitting).\n",
