    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we learn how to implement and evaluate more complex models when simpler techniques aren't enough. We'll explore ensemble models, a powerful approach in machine learning that combines multiple models to improve performance. Ensemble methods often outperform individual models by reducing overfitting and improving generalization.\n",
