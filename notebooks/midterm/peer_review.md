## Section 1 - Clarity and Organization
- What's working well
  - The notebook is clear and logical and matches the flow outlined in our examples.
  - The tables appear right after training which makes results easier to find.
  - ROC curves are included.  THese are great for quick interpretation.
- Suggestions
  - Add brief one sentences intros at the top of each major section, "This is what we will see in this section" to help guide your viewer.

## Section 2 - Feature Selection and Justification
- What's working well
  - You explained missing value handling and performed scaling for numeric features.
- Suggestions
  - For your encodings, consider selecting which features you will be using first, and then encode to avoid teh 1700 columns created in this step.

## Section 3 - Model Performance and Comparisons
- What's working well
  - Logistic Regression and Random Forest are trained and evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, plus ROC AUC and PR AUC.
  - I loved the threshold table.
- Suggestions
  - Add a compact comparison table (one row per model)

## Section 4 - Reflection Quality
- What's working well
  - Overall, reflections were well thought out and explanatory.
- Suggestions
  - No suggestions.  Reflections were great.

Summary:  A solid, well structured, well thought out evaluation.  I loved the different models which were chosen.  The visuals were great as well.  Great job!
